Camelot Expansion Pack for Game Dev Tycoon
===========

**Version:** 0.1.3.2b
**Last Update:** 12-DEC-2013
**Formerly:** Staff Role Improvements 

**Description:**
----------
Expansion pack to bring lots of new functionality to the game.

I most likely will not be adding topics, platforms, etc (unless required by a module of the pack)
There are many great mods that do this already, considering using @DzjengisKhan expansion pack along side Camelot for a brand new experience. 

----------
I am very open to ideas, suggestions, requests.
I have never programmed in javascript before I have just been reading through the code learning by trial and error. So if you have improvement suggestions on the code I am happy to listen :smile: 

It is a work in progress so I have currently only added some initial ideas. The code is also pretty messy at the moment.

Currently Working On: Grid

**Known Issues:**
----------
 - None


----------


**Added Features:**
----------
 - **Staff Training** - When making a game staff have the chance to improve one of their skills.
 - **Specialism** - Added "Advanced Option" at character creation you can specialise in Design or Tech or you can increase the default skills slightly right off the bat.

It's very much untested in the long run currently so I would appreciate some testers/feedback.
Not 100% sure how it will react to old saves as I don't currently have any, but it should integrate well and work with other mods.

**Planned Features**
----------
  - **Game Modes**
 - **One Man Machine** - Gamemode based on being stuck in the garage.
This mod will have an adjust story line allowing you to gain research, training and such. 
It will be very much a "Survival" mode.
 - **Sandbox** - Starting out at the last level with a random assortment already in your repertoire.
 - **Story Line** - Planning on adding in some story lines that have multiple out comes, events and such that you must play through. I am thinking something like the story from "Uplink" but a GameDev version. Possibly adding multiple different "Campaigns" to the game to allow for radically different play throughs.

  - **Grid Expansion** - Plan on adding extra features for when you release Grid
  - **Competition** - Plan on adding some competition and the ability to "buy them out"
  - **Out Sourcing** - Add some functionality to have design and tech "outsourced" to increase point production.
  - **Office Improvements** - Add some toys and things around the office to reduce the need for going on vocation. 
  - **Stock Market** - Ability to buy and sell shares to generate some much needed cash. Will hopefully tie this in with the competition feature aswell. 
  - **Marketing Expansion** - Addtional Marketing Methods and features
 - **Charity Events** - Ability to host charity events for hype and fans
  - **Company Logos** - Custom Logos.
 - **Engine Market** - Ability to buy game engines from other companies.
 - **Team Leaders** - Your guys can train to be team leaders and get that much needed help in their field when it comes to AAA games
