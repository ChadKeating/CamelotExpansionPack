[WIP] Staff Role Improvements [BETA]
============
This mod is intended to add some extra functionality when in comes to staff and I have also add some other features/events which I will event break off this mod into multiple smaller mods when they get large enough as I plan to build upon everything here.

I am very open to ideas and I have never programmed in javascript before I have just been reading through the code learning that way. So if you have improvement suggestions on the code I am happy to listen :smile: 

It is a work in progress so I have currently only added some initial ideas.

**Added Features:**

 - **Staff Training** - When making a game staff have the chance to improve one of their skills.
 - **Specialism** - Added "Advanced Option" at character creation you can specialise in Design or Tech or you can increase the default skills slightly right off the bat. 
 - **Extended Game** - Added some game length options for very long game play. 60 and 84 years.

**Added Events:**

 - **Steal** - A staff member may steal some of your money. *(Low chance)*
 - **Bail Out** - A staff member may get arrested.
 - **Better Offer** - A staff member may get a better offer from another company when doing contracts.
 - **Lottery** - Very low chance of winning the lottery.
