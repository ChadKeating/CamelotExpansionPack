Camelot Expansion Pack for Game Dev Tycoon
===========

**Version:** 0.1.3.3b

**Last Update:** 21-DEC-2013

**Description:**
----------
Expansion pack to bring lots of new functionality to the game.

I most likely will not be adding topics, platforms, etc (unless required by a module of the pack)
There are many great mods that do this already, considering using @DzjengisKhan expansion pack along side Camelot for a brand new experience. 

----------
I am very open to ideas, suggestions, requests.
I have never programmed in javascript before I have just been reading through the code learning by trial and error. So if you have improvement suggestions on the code I am happy to listen :smile: 

It is a work in progress so I have currently only added some initial ideas. The code is also pretty messy at the moment.

Currently Working On: Grid

**Known Issues:**
----------
 - None


----------


**Added Features:**
----------
 - **Staff Training** - When making a game staff have the chance to improve one of their skills.
 - **Specialism** - Added "Advanced Option" at character creation you can specialise in Design or Tech or you can increase the default skills slightly right off the bat.

 - **Extended Game** - Added some game length options for very long game play. 60 and 84 years.

**Added Events:**
----------
 - **Steal** - A staff member may steal some of your money. *(Low chance)*
 - **Bail Out** - A staff member may get arrested.
 - **Better Offer** - A staff member may get a better offer from another company when doing contracts.
 - **Lottery** - Very low chance of winning the lottery.		

----------

It's very much untested in the long run currently so I would appreciate some testers/feedback.
Not 100% sure how it will react to old saves as I don't currently have any, but it should integrate well and work with other mods.
ers** - Your guys can train to be team leaders and get that much needed help in their field when it comes to AAA games
