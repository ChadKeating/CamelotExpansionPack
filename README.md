[WIP] Staff Role Improvements [BETA]
============
This mod is intended to add some extra functionality when in comes to staff and I have also add some other features/events which I will event break off this mod into multiple smaller mods when they get large enough as I plan to build upon everything here.

I am very open to ideas and I have never programmed in javascript before I have just been reading through the code learning that way. So if you have improvement suggestions on the code I am happy to listen :smile: 

It is a work in progress so I have currently only added some initial ideas.

**Added Features:**

 - **Staff Training** - When making a game staff have the chance to improve one of their skills.
 - **Specialism** - Added "Advanced Option" at character creation you can specialise in Design or Tech or you can increase the default skills slightly right off the bat. 
 - **Extended Game** - Added some game length options for very long game play. 60 and 84 years.
 - **Debugging Ext** - Can now research new methods of debugging for faster debugging speeds.

**Added Events:**

 - **Steal** - A staff member may steal some of your money. *(Low chance)*
 - **Bail Out** - A staff member may get arrested.
 - **Better Offer** - A staff member may get a better offer from another company when doing contracts.
 - **Lottery** - Very low chance of winning the lottery.

It's very much untested in the long run currently so I would appreciate some testers/feedback.
Not 100% sure how it will react to old saves as I don't currently have any, but it should integrate well and work with other mods.

**Planned Features**

  - **Game Modes**
 - **One Man Machine** - Gamemode based on being stuck in the garage.
This mod will have an adjust story line allowing you to gain research, training and such. 
It will be very much a "Survival" mode.
 - **Story Line** - Planning on adding in some story lines that have multiple out comes, events and such that you must play through. I am thinking something like the story from "Uplink" but a GameDev version. Possibly adding multiple different "Campaigns" to the game to allow for radically different play throughs.

  - **Grid Expansion** - Plan on adding extra features for when you release Grid
  - **Competition** - Plan on adding some competition and the ability to "buy them out"
  - **Out Sourcing** - Add some functionality to have design and tech "outsourced" to increase point production.
